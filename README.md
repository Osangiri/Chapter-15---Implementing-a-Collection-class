# Chapter-15-Implementing-a-Collection-class
The Ch15test file contains a java program to implement an ArrayStack that includes the following methods.
peek, push, pop, realloc, toStringequals(Object) and clear.
I also had to write the junit tester to test the ArrayStack
I did a plantUML file from what we learned in class.I added the ArrayStack.puml file and also attached the puml picture below.
This was quite challenging and I had to do a lot of research online to understand some concepts.
